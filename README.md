🛒**Ecommerce Customer Churn Analysis**

📌**Overview**

In this project, I analyzed customer churn to understand why customers leave and what the business can do to retain them. The goal was to turn customer data into clear, actionable insights that support better decisions across marketing, pricing, and operations.

Rather than focusing on technical complexity, the analysis is centered on real business problems and practical outcomes.

❓**Key Business Questions**

Which marketing channels bring customers who stay longer?

Are discounts helping build loyalty or attracting only price-sensitive customers?

Does delivery speed have a direct impact on customer retention?

At what stage in the customer journey do most customers churn?

Which high-value customers should be prioritized for retention efforts?

🔍**How the Analysis Was Done**

Cleaned and prepared customer data to ensure accuracy and reliability

Segmented customers based on behavior, value, and churn risk

Compared churn trends across acquisition channels and seasonal periods

Identified early signs of churn to support proactive retention actions

Used cohort analysis to track customer retention over time

Built Power BI dashboards to visualize churn trends and present insights to non-technical stakeholders

🛠️**Tools Used**
